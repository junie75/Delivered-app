# Delivered App

Welcome to the Delivered repository. Please note that this project is currently ongoing and unfinished. Expect frequent updates and improvements.

Delivered is a mobile application created to run on both IOS and Android. This platform is a mail delivery notification system to assist school mailrooms, 
specifically the St. Maryâ€™s University mailroom, in notifying users of the mailroom when packages have arrived, creating one location where all mail information can be found, 
and overall improving the efficiency of the mailroom.
